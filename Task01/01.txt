In this lecture, the speaker cast double on the advantages of four-day week mentioned in the passage, and the opinions were summarized as three aspects. First of all, the shortened workweek wouldn't increase company profits. As each person speed less time on their work, the company have to hire more people to accomplish the same amount of work, the whole expense would be greater than before. For instance, the company must provide extra training courses, office space, computers, medical benefits for persons. After understanding this issue, we can understand the company actually cost more than before. Offering this option would not reduce unemployment rates. A shortened workweek would only cause the fact that the company would force employees to do the same amount of work of five-day week, as the work can be accomplished by existed employees, the company wouldn't hire more people for the job position, as less employees means less expenses. Finally, four-day workweek might be harmful for individual employees. It decrease the employees' job ability to accomplish the goal, and do harm to advance their career. From the perspective of company, they actually would like someone who works five days per week, as the workers can easily grow to a strong job ability. Based on the fact, the workers of four-day workday might pass over the promotion. To conclude, a four-day workweek does not necessarily benefit the whole economy as a whole, or individual companies, or employees.
